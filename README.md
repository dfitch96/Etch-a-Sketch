# Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to the __Etch-a-Sketch Project__! This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and serves as a great opportunity to showcase and improve my DOM manipulation skills.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a browser-based drawing tool inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. The implementation will be a hybrid between a sketchpad and a digital Etch-a-Sketch, allowing users to draw directly on the screen using their mouse or keyboard.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Grid**: Create a dynamic grid that users can draw on.
- **Customizable Design**: Allow users to adjust grid size and experiment with different colors and effects.
- **DOM Manipulation Practice**: Utilize JavaScript to dynamically update and interact with HTML and CSS elements.
- **Responsive and User-Friendly UI**: Ensure the tool is accessible and enjoyable on a variety of devices.
